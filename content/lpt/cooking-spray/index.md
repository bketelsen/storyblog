Avoid some cleanup with this tiny life hack.

<!--more-->

Many times when you're cooking you need to spray the pan with non-stick spray. Up until recently I did this with the pan on the stove. Now I move the stove to the sink and spray with the pan in the sink. The sink catches the overspray instead of the stovetop. Trust me there's *always* overspray. Now there's less mess on the stove top!

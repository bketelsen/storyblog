For Nathan, on his first day at college.

<!--more-->

My oldest child went off to college yesterday.  Before he said goodbye he asked me if I had any advice for him as he started the independent part of his life.

I thought for a moment and told him I would give him an answer later. I knew there wasn't just one thing I wanted to tell him; there would be hundreds -- maybe thousands of things I would remember randomly that I wanted him to know.  So I decided to make a segment on my blog here of Life Pro Tips. They're for Nate, but maybe other people will enjoy them too.

# Pay in Cash

It will be tempting to use credit to make purchases; especially purchases of things outside your day-to-day expenses. Resist this. Instead make it your habit to only buy things that you can purchase with cash on hand.

This is a good policy for several reasons:

1. You won't become a slave to your debt. If you buy something with credit, it owns YOU, not the other way around.
2. Taking a bit of time to save for a purchase gives you the opportunity to research the best options and make a solid choice. 
3. Having a cash-only policy will reduce the amount of your impulse spending.

Some things aren't easy to buy in cash. I'd make a general exception for purchasing a home.

## But How Do I Build Credit?

If you're paying for everything in cash, you might be wondering how you're going to build a good credit history. Open a credit card account with your bank (this part is important) and use it for a subset of your regular monthly purchases. Set it to auto pay from your checking account. Now you can think of those purchases as cash purchases while you build a history of on-time credit payments. Pick just one or two things like your cell phone bill or groceries.
